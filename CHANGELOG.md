# Changelog

## Unreleased: model/provider controls
- Four MCP tools read the current model/provider and fallback order, switch all existing gateway sessions or one session, and replace the fallback order. Write tools are annotated as writes and require the JWT gate's verified owner identity.
- A gateway-owned local socket applies persisted session overrides and atomic configuration changes without interrupting running turns. The Son image must install and activate the hook; no release tag or fleet rollout is implied.
- See [MODEL-CONTROL.md](docs/MODEL-CONTROL.md) for authentication, scope limits and deployment requirements.

## v0.1.6 (2026-10-23): store submission build
- Discord paid add-on renamed **Discord thread management — two-way sync**, $5/mo (was $10). Plain Discord chat is free, like Telegram and WhatsApp.
- Store test instructions: reviewers sign up free at aiteam.space, no card, no pre-built reviewer Son.
- Full Discord control: read any channel or thread, raw Discord API, behind the same add-on gate.
- Bundled usage skill regenerated from `usage_guide.py`.

## v0.1.5 (2026-10-16)
- First submission build: bundled skills + MCP, brand and voice-mode assets, Claude plugin bundle.
